The Customer Should Implement a classical Agile Over SAFe.
First of all, The Agile methodologies stand out for their flexibility and adaptability, especially when compared to SAFe,which can introduce a level of rigidity less conducive to rapid change and innovation. Especially in this case with many different actors, the structures that SAFe provides may not be a benefit but a detriment. 

also, The iterative nature of Agile and emphasis on the continuous assessment allow for more dynamic response to evolving project requirements and feedback of the sstakeholders.

Finally, Agileâ€™s focus on collaborative decision-making and a culture of accountability and creativity which enhances project outcomes by tapping into diverse perspectives and expertise by the participants but also the stakeholders, that will create constant feedback.
