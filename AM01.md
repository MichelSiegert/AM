# Advanced Modelling Lesson 1 
#### 23.03.2024 Michel Siegert

Generic notes relevant to exam: 
* Lüssem Likes Szenarios so I suppose I have to write some.

## Scenarios
There are different types of Szenarios.
* Positive scenario (how does it work)
* Negative scenario (what shouldn't happen?)
    * Negative Allowed (Exceeding credit limit)
    * Negative Forbidden (Wrong amount of money returned)
* Misuse scenario (Abuse the system to your advantage.)
    Scenarios give context to goals. 


# Boundaries
 Look at the figure on page 222.
 There are boundaries what a system is supposed to do within a given context. 
 The Systen acts within the context and is surrounded by Irrelevant context (things we don't really need to consider.)
 There are grey zones in the borders of what is in the system, as the requirements may change and so things that were out of scope turn scope are now in scope, and the other way around. 

 ## Scope Creep
 The scope of the project keeps expanding. Perhaps then changing to a more agile structure is required as the static analysis can be thrown out the window quite often. 
 Note: if this happens later in the project this might massively increase the cost of the Project. 

 # Deliverables
 Lüssem Said we were not going to talk about this.
 BUT WE DO THIS ANYONE BABEY!
 Lastenheft and Pflichtenheft are Deliverables. 

 # Estimation
Why? Customer wants to know how long the project takes and how much it will cost.
Estimations are quite difficult. The thing in programming is that encountering a problem takes the most time in this context. Keep in mind that those are just estimates, dont give precise numbers if you don't have them.
## Different Methods
1. Analogy methods (compare with older projects) (Slide ~260)
    1. Linear Estimation Methdod (LOC * time per line to calculate.)
    THIS SOUNDS BAD! Why would you do this?  
    2. Percentage Estimation Method
    You have a table of all information (Slide 262)
    Scale it compared to other Projects.
    This sounds quite Reasonable![^1]
2. Expert Estimation Methods
    If you only rely on experts you dont seem trustworthy because you can't do small adjustments to the fly.
    Also ask the person that are actually implementing the Project in the end.
    Why is this good? they know what they talk about and if they dont you can shift the blame!
    1. Individual Opinion Method
        You ask for one Expert. Take them with the grain of salt.
    2. Delphi Method
        everyone makes guesses you make question rounds to try and get closer until a consensus is reached.
3. 3 Point Estimation Method(skipped)
4. Cocomo(skipped)
5. Function Point Analysis (its older than me!)
### Function Point Analysis
NOTE: THis only takes functional requirements into account.
There is a Rapid Approach. 
What kind of Functions have to be Implemented.
You give points for whenever you input and Output something. 
The complexity doesn't have to be looked at because some functions may be more difficult, but some are easier and over time it equals out. 
#### Advantages of StakeholderAnalysis
it is Language independent!
Not depending on Engineering Things.
This is somewhat easier to gage for Project managers who have no idea about computer science. 



# Pre and Post Traceability of  Requirements
Predecessor Artefacts are things like Jira. 

# Prio
It would be good if the tickets can be classified as what is important, so people know where to start. 

## Kano Classification
Didn't I have this in the bachelor already? 
Satisfiers/Dissatisfiers Delighters
Satisfiers are Specified and Conscious.
Dissatisfiers are not articulated and they are self evident.
Delighters not expected and is not Conscious. 

A dissatifier on a phone would be you cant call.
A Satisfier is a good camera.
A Delighter would be Image manipulation (the stuff gooogle does!) [^1]
If you could choose between a delighter and a satisfier you should implement a delighter? But doesn't that logic create a Dissatisfier? 

SLIDE 313: (Cost value diagram) What the fuck R1 is so fucking bad. [^2]

# Inspection Rates
What is a good rate for a page? how much time should you spend on a document? if you read 100pages/h you get ~1 mistake. for Documents its 20 Minutes/page.
In Programms its 100LOC/h .

# Errors and where they come from
Errors are produces mostly in Design and Implementation(40, 50%). 10% are in the requirements. However Most mistakes will only be found during testing. However, the later they are found the more expensive it is to fix them. Especially in Production. 
In Testing loads of mistakes are found, yet not all of them. This can be found at page 349.

# Agile!
[The agile Manifest is here!](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
Scrum is used mostly.
Most do hybrid but saying that u use scrum is trendy.
It just means to make very small projects that you then plan and execute and then give back to the customer and they give you feedback over and over. this takes loads of time for the customer, and also copious amounts of times in meetings for developers (that in my experience have never been useful and couldve been emails!).
I also think that many people in the sphere value tools way too highly, which DIRECTLY GOES AGAINST THE FIRST LINE OF THE AGILE MANIFESTO. I mean They love Jira, Kanban, burndown charts, planning poker, ... not saying there is no value, but Individuals and Interactions are more important. 
There is a PO, a customer proxy. 
THere is a scrum master who ensures that the others can work without interruption. 
THe developers Develop. 

The resources and Dates how long one sprint takes is fixed, but the requirements are created over time. 

## User stories
User stories are kind of scenarios but less precise. 
There are Acceptance criterias for these stories. 

## MVP
MVP is the Minimum Viable Product. 
Its the least thing the customer wants.
Its like the bare minimum and should not reflect the end result.

## Planning poker
Take a number how much work it takes.
HIghest and lowest number argue about how much work is done. Then you play another round until it converges on a number. 

## Velocity
How many points does the team manage to fulfill in a sprint. NOTE from my experience, rewarding teams due to increased velocity leads to worse poker, so don't judge people for changing velocity. They just guess more and more points.

# Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
Agile means work in small teams.
So what if u want to get the advantages of agile developement in a large team? Perhaps you should turn the large project into several different artifacts and just get several teams working on several Artifacts. OR you scale Scrum like described in page 408. Im not a fan of this if it wasn't obvious. 
Note that it is difficult to turn one monolithic project into this and older hierarchies are there, and they wont disappear in 1 one moment because the company decides to be fully agile. 
And this is a good compromise. 
Buuuuut it is not a good solution! :C

# #EhreAnLüssem (#creditsToLüssem)
We end 1 hour early, to do """work""" at Home. 


# Notes from the case Study
Describe Use cases with Scenarios. 


[^1]: The other Prof. is constantly coughing. Dude stay at home when youre sick, what the heck.
[^2]: the numbers may be wrong due to Lüssem adding some Pages.
